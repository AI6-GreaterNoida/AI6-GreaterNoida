# AI Saturdays Lesson Plan

Here are learning roadmaps organised in weeks. Each week consists of lecture videos, reading materials and programming assignments. Feel free to head to the [AI6 forums](https://ai6forums.nurture.ai/) to discuss or ask questions you might have.

Machine Learning from Scratch

This is for anyone who wants to learn Machine Learning or TensorFlow. The only prerequisite is high school math and a ton of passion.  We will follow [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) by Google - it breaks down concepts of Machine Learning in fun, bite-sized portions and provides thoughtful exercises to deepen your understanding.

Research-focused Lesson Plan

Learners of this track are those who have acquired the prerequisites to understand and implement state of the art AI models. They can choose from one or more of the following courses : UCL course on Reinforcement Learning (UCL RL), Berkeley CS294, Stanford Natural Language Processing (CS224n) and Stanford Computer Vision (CS231n).

These courses are offered by their respective universities and (fortunately for us) are freely accessible by the public. Learning materials for the courses can be quite &#39;scattered&#39;, i.e lecture videos for these courses are not found on the official website but on youtube; they are also not aligned with the course outline on the official website.We will follow one lecture video from youtube every week and refer to the official pages for lecture notes or assignments.

Bonus tips

- --The lecture videos go up to 2 hours; watch the lecture video at 2x speed, slowing down only at parts that cover important concepts
- --Revise and make sure that you have **mastered** the fundamentals of deep learning
- --Don&#39;t aim to understand everything and anything.
